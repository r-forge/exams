Supported \extype{}s:

*** void
(anyone a better name???)
No solution in Meta-Information, exams are corrected manually by
humans (students return printed paper, PDF, whatever).  Still usefull
to have in package exams to automatically create random questions from given
DGPs.

*** string
same as now in exams

*** mchoice
same as now in exams

*** num
same as now in exams, 1 or 2 numeric answers

*** vec
currently under development in BOKUexams: result is a numeric vector,
logical questions are encoded as 0/1, \exsoltype{} states which
question has which type, questions can be grouped to form mchoice
blocks or simply draw a box around questions that are closely related.
In principle we could simply generalize num, but \exsolution{}{} does
not scale well for many answers, \exsolution{1|2|3|4} or whatever is
much easier to split. So for backwards compatibility I suggest to use
a new type. In addition many elearning platforms have question type
"numeric" where the solution has to be scalar.
