## Requirements

As far as Patrik remembers:

  * ruby
  * bundler
  * jekyll

## Usage

`make` or `make dev` start a local http server that observes changes of
the source files and updates incrementally.

`make install` populates `../www/dev/` with a live version of the
website.

## List of Open Points

- adapt /humans.txt to mimic /about.html
