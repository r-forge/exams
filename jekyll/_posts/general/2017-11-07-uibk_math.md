### Motivation

Many statisticians regularly teach large lecture courses on statistics,
probability, or mathematics for students from other fields such as business and
economics, social sciences and psychology, etc. A common challenge in such
courses is that many variations of similar exercises are needed for written
exams, online tests conducted in learning management systems (LMS, such as Moodle,
Blackboard, etc.), or live quizzes with voting via smartphones or tablets. 

Here, it is shown how the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/statistics/)
at [Universität Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/) manages the first-year
mathematics 101 course for economics and business students, attended by
about 500 to 1,000 students per semester. The course is accessible through the
university's LMS (an [OpenOLAT](https://www.openolat.com/)
system), including anonymous _"Guest access"_ for most materials. So you can either
look at the screen shots presented below in this blog post or try out the course yourself:
<https://lms.uibk.ac.at/url/RepositoryEntry/3051978752?guest=true>.
(Notes: The course materials are in German but also non-German-speakers should get a
good impression of how things are tied together. The online tests contain mathematical
equations in MathML which is displayed by browsers with MathML support like Firefox or
Safari - _but not Chrome_.)


### Course overview

As highschool knowledge about mathematics is rather heterogeneous among the students, the
course has been designed so that they can learn either synchronously (in a classical
lecture that is also streamed live) or asynchronously (with a textbook and/or screencasts).
This way students can decide which parts of the content just need reviewing and which
need deepening. Similarly, they can get feedback (not directly relevant for their grade) during
lecture and tutorial sessions synchronously or asynchronously "in their own time". Finally,
the assessment is also done in two parts: online tests that they can do over the course of the semester
(at any time within a 3.5-day window each) and a classical written exam at the end of the semester.


&nbsp;           | Learning                   | Feedback                                   | Assessment                    |
:----------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
**Synchronous**  | Lecture <br/> Live stream  | [Live quiz](#live-quiz) <br/> (+ Tutorial) | [Written exam](#written-exam) |
**Asynchronous** | Textbook <br/> Screencast  | [Self test](#online-test) <br/> (+ Forum)  | [Online test](#online-test)   |

Subsequently, it will be discussed how the different feedback and assessment formats are generated
with R/exams from the same pool of exercise templates.

<!--

Thus, the _learning_ phase is not so unusual:
* _Standard:_ Textbook along with presentation slides.
* _Streaming:_ Videos streamed simultaneously or (pre-)recorded.

But for _feedback_ and _assessment_ the following is required:
* _Scalability:_ Randomized dynamic exercises.
* _Feedback:_ Support for either just the correct answer or the complete approach to the correct solution.
* _Flexibility:_ Automatic rendering into different assessment formats.

### Exercises

The core of the course are about 400 [dynamic exercise templates](/intro/dynamic) where students have to compute some number based on
a problem description or a short story. Some examples from this pool have also been translated into English and included in R/exams, e.g.,
[deriv](/templates/deriv/), [lagrange](/templates/lagrange/), [hessian](/templates/hessian/).
Almost all of these exercises have been established as num exercises first (with numeric result,
employed in online tests) and then [converted to single-choice format](/tutorials/static_num_schoice/)
(schoice, see e.g. [deriv2](/templates/deriv2/)) as this format can be easily scanned automatically in
[written exams](/intro/written/). Additionally, there are about 70 dynamic multiple-choice questions
(mchoice) that are used either in online tests or live quizzes.

As illustrated in the following, these exercises are the thread running through the enitre course, starting with
the lecture slides where typically one static snapshot from an exercise is used (potentially with
some additional explanations, incremental slides, graphics, etc.) Below
we show screenshots from such a curve sketching exercise in the screencasts (based on the slides).
It depicts a simple cubic polynomial of type <em>a x<sup>3</sup> + b x<sup>2</sup> + c x + d</em>
for which the two local optima and the inflection point have to be found.

### Online test

The corresponding dynamic exercise templates can then be used in an online test.
In fact, here there are three dynamic templates that draw different coefficients _a_, _b_, _c_,
and _d_ and either ask for the function value _f(x)_ in one of the local optima (A or C), or the
second derivative _f''(x)_ in one of the local optima (A or C), or the slope _f'(x)_ in the
inflection point B.

In the screenshots below the second derivative _f''(x)_ in C is demanded, but the argument _x_
is C incorrectly entered/saved by the student, prompting OpenOLAT to display the full correct approach to the solution.

[![onlinetest2.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/onlinetest2-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/onlinetest2.png)

To import an online test into OpenOLAT, an XML-based exchange format by the IMS Global Learning Consortium is used:
[IMS Question & Test Interoperability, Version 1.2](http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv1p2/imsqti_asi_bindv1p2.html) (QTI 1.2).
The R/exams function `exams2qti12()` generates a zipped XML file
that can be imported into OpenOLAT as a complete online test. To do so
we first set up a list of exercises à la:

```{r}
otest <- list(
  c("deriv-poly.Rnw", "deriv-sqrt.Rnw", "deriv-exp.Rnw", ...),
  c("graph-deriv-A.Rnw", "graph-deriv-B.Rnw", "graph-deriv-C.Rnw"),
  ...
)
```

And then `exams2qti12()` can proceed to draw many replications from this combining two forms of
randomization: (a) Sampling one item from a given vector of exercise templates (e.g., here
the `deriv-*.Rnw` templates for the first item). (b) In each `.Rnw` template random
numbers are drawn and inserted into the exercise (e.g., the coefficients _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_
in the cubic polynomial). For example:

```{r}
exams2qti12(otest, n = 500, name = "Mathematik-Onlinetest-01", 
  solutionswitch = FALSE, maxattempts = 2, cutvalue = 1000)
```

draws 500 random versions for each of the items in the test. We don't
show the correct solution approach at the end (only the correct numeric result, `solutionswitch = FALSE`)
but allow our students to attempt each item within the test twice (i.e., one wrong attempt is
tolerated). Because individual tests cannot be passed or failed (they just collect points for
the overall course), we set `cutvalue = 1000` which can never be attained. Due to the large
exercise pools and the large number of random variations, the students cannot simply copy
a single number or a certain solution formula. Of course, during a 3.5-day test it is possible
to help each other and in fact we encourage the students to form small learning groups.

Further control arguments of `exams2qti12()` include the number of `points` and the `eval` strategy (e.g., 
for negative points upon incorrect results etc.). See `?exams2qti` for more technical
details and also for an example you can run yourself based on exercises from the 
[template gallery](/templates/).

In addition to the online tests (= assessment) we employ self tests (= feedback), either in the
form of selected demo exercises ("Musteraufgaben") for which the full solution approach is shown
(`solutionswitch = TRUE`), short tests that sample exercises from almost the entire exercise
pool ("Selbsttests"), or "mock exams" based on past written exams ("Probeklausuren").

**Self test**      <br/> (Selbsttest)     | schoice              | 3-20                     |                     | x                              |                   | 1                       | &infin;                 | Feedback <br/> during semester   |
**Mock exam**      <br/> (Probeklausur)   | schoice              | 1                        |                     |                                | 90                | &infin;                 | &infin;                 | Feedback <br/> before exam       |

As the written exams use single-choice versions of the exercises, the latter two test types 
also practice using this item type (see the screenshot below).

[![onlinetest3.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/onlinetest3-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/onlinetest3.png)


### Written exam

The course ends in a "strict" written exam ("Gesamtprüfung") in the sense that now each student really
has to solve his/her own exam without further help in a time window of 90 minutes.
The function employed for generating the PDF files is `exams2nops()` and its usage
is illustrated in detail in the tutorial on [written exams](/tutorials/exams2nops/).

First, a _vector_ (as opposed to a _list_) of exercises is set up à la:

```{r}
gp <- c(
  "deriv-sqrt.Rnw",
  "graph-deriv-B.Rnw",
  ...
)
```

Thus, for written exams we assure that every student gets the same exercise template,
only with some random variations of the numbers/graphics/etc. Thus, we try to make the
exam as fair as possible while assuring that cheating is very hard. If there are, say,
400 participants in the exam, there are 400 different exams with single-choice
exercises. These can be generated (typically after setting a random seed for reproducibility)
via:

```{r}
set.seed(2017-04-05)
exams2nops(gp, n = 400, name = "GP", title = "GP Mathematik",
  institution = "Universit\\\"at Innsbruck", logo = "uibk-logo-bw.png",
  language = "de", course = "403100--200", date = "2017-04-05", reglength = 7,
  pages = c("/path/to/formulary.pdf", "/path/to/normal-table.pdf"))
```

Thus, in addition to some information about course/exam, we specify the language (German), length of the registration
ID (7 digits), and add PDF pages with the formulary and normal tables.
The first few pages of one of the resulting PDFs are displayed below. More details on the
evaluation process can be found in the [exams2nops](/tutorials/exams2nops/) tutorial.

[![nops1.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/nops1-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/nops1.png)
[![nops2.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/nops2-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/nops2.png)

A very nice benefit of using R/exams here is that we can share an interactive online
"mock exam" ("Probeklausur") in addition to the PDF version in the exam archive. This
can again be generated by `exams2qti12()` with time limit and evaluation settings
corresponding to the actual written exam:

```{r}
exams2qti12(gp, n = 10, name = "Mathematik-GP-2017-04-05",
  maxattempts = Inf, cutvalue = 18, solutionswitch = FALSE,
  points = 2, eval = list(partial = FALSE, negative = -0.25),
  duration = 90)
```

The screen shots below show first the interactive version of the mock exam and then
one of the PDFs in the resources archive.

[![mockexam1.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/mockexam1-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/mockexam1.png)
[![mockexam2.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/mockexam2-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/mockexam2.png)


### Live quiz

Finally, the same exercise templates can also be imported into live quizzes when the
audience response system ARSnova is used (see <https://arsnova.eu/>). As we do not use
the system for assessment but only for feedback it is not as important to have a lot
of random variation in the exercises, but it certainly helps to avoid duplication
across courses taught in parallel or in subsequent semesters.
Moreover, the R/exams function `exams2arsnova()` can directly import the drawn exercises
into ARSnova using its REST interface (via Rcurl and suitable JSON data). Alternatively,
JSON files can be generated on the hard disk and subsequently imported manually.

As an illustration we use again a vector of exercise templates and export random
draws from these directly into a previously-generated ARSnova session (using one
session for the enitre semester). Authentication can be done through the JSESSIONID.

```{r}
quiz <- c("deriv-sqrt.Rnw", "graph-deriv-B.Rnw", ...)
exams2arsnova(quiz, name = "Quiz", url = "https://arsnova.uibk.ac.at",
  sessionkey = "79732490", jsessionid = "34A6B8C1D83CB7D0EC66F14DA7044DB1",
  fix_choice = FALSE, abstention = FALSE)
```

The students can then view the exercises on the mobile phones or tablets, practicing for
the exam, followed by a phase of peer instruction to resolve remaining problems.

[![arsnova1.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/arsnova1-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/arsnova1.png)
[![arsnova2.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/arsnova2-thumb.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-11-07-uibk_math/arsnova2.png)

Exercises like shown in the two screenshots above are used for exam practice during lecture
or tutorial sessions. Additionally, knowledge quiz questions
are frequently used for checking whether the students can follow the lecture or not.
These are typically in the form of multiple-choice questions where each subitem can either be
true or false. See [gaussmarkov](/templates/gaussmarkov/) for a worked example.

### Summary

This blog post has shown how the same pool of exercises can be used flexibly for
different elements of a large-lecture course. Over the last years we experimented
quite a bit with these and kept those elements we (or the students) found useful
but discontinued using others. Of course, the hard part is establishing the large
exercise pool but then R/exams enables us to try out different formats fairly easily.

If you have further questions about these tools or want to let us know how you
use R/exams in your course, please get in touch! Either via
[our forum, StackOverflow, Twitter, or simply by e-mail](/contact/).
