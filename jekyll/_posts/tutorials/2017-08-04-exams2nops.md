## Preliminaries

This tutorial demonstrates how to manage [written exams](/written/) with multiple-choice
and/or single-choice questions in R/exams. On the R side this involves three steps:
1. Exam generation (PDF files, 1 per exam).
2. Scan resulting sheets (PDF or PNG format).
3. Evaluate results and generate reports.

To begin, start your R session in a dedicated directory for your exam and load the `exams` package.


{% highlight r %}
library("exams")
{% endhighlight %}

## Exam generation

First, define an exam `myexam` which is simply a list of exercises.


{% highlight r %}
myexam <- list(
  "tstat2.Rnw",
  "ttest.Rnw",
  "relfreq.Rnw",
  "anova.Rnw",
  c("boxplots.Rnw", "scatterplot.Rnw"),
  "cholesky.Rnw"
)
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we use a number of `schoice` and `mchoice` questions that are directly shipped
within the package. In practice, you would use files that you have authored and stored
somewhere locally. Above, the exercises in .Rnw format are used but all of the examples
are also available in .Rmd format, leading to virtually identical output.


Then, we create `n = 2` randomly drawn versions from this exam on the disk in a new
output directory `nops_pdf/`. To customize the exam we assign a different number of
points to the different exercises and also show the respective number of points at
the beginning of each question.


{% highlight r %}
set.seed(403)
ex1 <- exams2nops(myexam, n = 2,
  dir = "nops_pdf", name = "demo", date = "2015-07-29",
  points = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3), showpoints = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

A random seed is set to make the generated exams exactly reproducible for you
(or ourselves at some point in the future). All metainformation is stored in a list of
lists `ex1` which we do not use here.

The output directory now contains three files that were generated: the two PDF files
are the two exams we requested above. Furthermore, the metainfromation about the exam
(exam IDs, questions, correct and wrong answer alternatives) is stored in a .rds
file (serialized R data). The latter is crucial for being able to evaluate the exam
later on.


{% highlight r %}
dir("nops_pdf")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "demo.rds"     "demo1.pdf"    "demo2.pdf"    "metainfo.rds"
## [5] "nops1.pdf"    "nops2.pdf"
{% endhighlight %}

Now the PDFs need to be printed out for the exam. (_Recommendation:_ The exams should
be stapled in the top left corner.)
