\begin{question}
In the following figure the distributions of a variable
given by two samples (A and B) are represented by parallel boxplots.
Which of the following statements are correct?  \emph{(Comment: The
statements are either about correct or clearly wrong.)}

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\textwidth}
\includegraphics{boxplots-002}

\begin{answerlist}
  \item The location of both distributions is about the same.
  \item Both distributions contain no outliers.
  \item The spread in sample A is clearly bigger than in B.
  \item The skewness of both samples is similar.
  \item Distribution A is right-skewed.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. Distribution B has on average higher values than distribution A.
  \item False. There are observations which deviate more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the median.
  \item True. The interquartile range in sample A is  clearly bigger than in B.
  \item True. The skewness of both distributions is similar, both are about symmetric.
  \item False. Distribution  A  is  about symmetric.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
