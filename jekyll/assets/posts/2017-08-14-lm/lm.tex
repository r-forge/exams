\begin{question}
Using the data provided in \url{regression.csv} estimate a linear regression of
\texttt{y} on \texttt{x} and answer the following questions.

\begin{answerlist}
  \item \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are not significantly correlated
  \item \texttt{y} increases significantly with \texttt{x}
  \item \texttt{y} decreases significantly with \texttt{x}
  \item Estimated slope with respect to \texttt{x}:
\end{answerlist}
 
\end{question}

\begin{solution}

To replicate the analysis in R:
\begin{verbatim}
## data
d <- read.csv("regression.csv")
## regression
m <- lm(y ~ x, data = d)
summary(m)
## visualization
plot(y ~ x, data = d)
abline(m)
\end{verbatim}
