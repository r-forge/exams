\begin{question}
The following figure shows a scatterplot. Which of the
following statements are correct?

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\textwidth}
\includegraphics{scatterplot-002}

\begin{answerlist}
  \item The absolute value of the correlation coefficient is at most $0.8$.
  \item The standard deviation of $X$ is at least $6$.
  \item For $X =  17.1 $, $Y$ can be expected to be about  19.9 .
  \item The scatterplot is standardized.
  \item The mean of $Y$ is at least $30$.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. A strong association between the variables is given in the scatterplot. Hence the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is close to $1$ and therefore larger than $0.8$.
  \item True. The standard deviation of $X$ is about equal to $ 20 $ and is therefore larger than $6$.
  \item True. The regression line at $X=17.1$ implies a value of about $Y = 19.9$.
  \item False. The scatterplot is not standardized, because $X$ and $Y$ do not both have mean $0$ and variance $1$.
  \item False. The mean of $Y$ is about equal to $ 20 $ and hence is smaller than $30$.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
