<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The waiting time (in minutes) at the cashier of two supermarket
chains with different cashier systems is compared. The following
statistical test was performed:</p>
<pre><code>
    Two Sample t-test

data:  Waiting by Supermarket
t = 4.1777, df = 108, p-value = 2.996e-05
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Sparag and group Consumo is greater than 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 1.241878      Inf
sample estimates:
 mean in group Sparag mean in group Consumo 
             5.419987              3.360063 </code></pre>
<p>Which of the following statements are correct? (Significance level 5%)</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
The absolute value of the test statistic is larger than 1.96.
</li>
<li>
A one-sided alternative was tested.
</li>
<li>
The p-value is larger than 0.05.
</li>
<li>
The test shows that the waiting time is longer at Sparag than at Consumo.
</li>
<li>
The test shows that the waiting time is shorter at Sparag than at Consumo.
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>
True. The absolute value of the test statistic is equal to 4.178.
</li>
<li>
True. The test aims at showing that the difference of means is larger than 0.
</li>
<li>
False. The p-value is equal to 3e-05.
</li>
<li>
True. The test result is significant (<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p &lt; 0.05</annotation></semantics></math>) and hence the alternative is shown that the difference of means is larger than 0.
</li>
<li>
False. The test aims at showing that the waiting time at Sparag is longer than at Consumo.
