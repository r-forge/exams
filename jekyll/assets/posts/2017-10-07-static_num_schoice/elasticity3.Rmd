## p = a - b * x
p <- sample(5:15, 1)
fctr <- sample(c(2, 4, 5, 10), 1)
x <- sample(5:15, 1) * fctr

Question
========
Consider the following inverse demand function:
$p(x) = `r a` - `r b` \cdot x$
for the price $p$ given the demanded quantity $x$.
What is the price elastiticy of demand at a price of
$p = `r p`$?


Solution
========
First, we obtain the demand function by inverting the
inverse demand function:
$x = D(p) = (`r a` - p)/`r b` = `r fmt(a/b, 6)` - `r fmt(1/b, 6)` \cdot p$.

Then, at $p = 5$ the price elasticity of demand is
$$
\frac{D'(p)}{D(p)} p = \frac{-`r fmt(1/b, 6)`}{`r x`} `r p` = `r fmt(sol, 6)`.
$$
