Question
========
Which statements are correct with respect to PCA?

Answerlist
----------
* the eigenvalue problem is solved by converting the covariance matrix into a matrix with linear independent variables
* the eigenvalue problem is solved by converting the covariance matrix into a matrix with variables that maximise variation
* the eigenvectors resulting from the analysis are only stretched or shrunk with the eigenvalues when multiplied with the raw data entering the analysis
* eigenvalues give the variance that each principal component represents
* eigenvalues give the variance that each variable explains of the principal component
