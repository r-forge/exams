Which of the following statements about the income elasticity of demand are correct? 

\begin{answerlist}
  \item If the income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is said to be a normal good.
  \item The income elasticity of demand indicates how strongly the demand for a good reacts to a change in income.

  \item The income elasticity of demand can be positive or negative.
  \item A Giffen good is a special case of an inferior good where demand increases if the price of the good increases.
  \item An income elasticity of demand equal to one means that the demand for the good increases proportional to the change in income.

  \item If the income elasticity of demand is greater than one, the good is called a normal good.
  \item The income elasticity of demand is the same for all consumers.
  \item The income elasticity of demand is independent of the good's price.
  \item The income elasticity of demand can range between zero and infinity.
