Automatic generation of exams based on exercises in Markdown or LaTeX format,
possibly including R code for dynamic generation of exercise elements. Exercise
types include single- and multiple-choice questions, arithmetic problems,
string questions, and combinations thereof (cloze). Output formats include PDF,
HTML, Moodle XML, QTI 1.2 (for OLAT/OpenOLAT), QTI 2.1, Blackboard, ARSnova,
and TCExam. In addition to fully customizable PDF exams, a standardized PDF
format is provided that can be printed, scanned, and automatically
evaluated.
