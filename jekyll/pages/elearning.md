### You want

- Online tests as part of your course.
- Your university provides a learning management system (like Moodle, Blackboard, OLAT, Ilias) but...
- ...entering exams "by hand" is tedious and ...
- ...you need (a large number of) random variations of similar exercises to reduce the risk of cheating.

### With R/exams you can

- Set up exercise templates.
- Easily draw (very many) random replications from these templates.
- Embed these into an exchange file format (typically in XML).
- Import this file into a learning management system. Either directly into an online test or into some question bank or item pool.
