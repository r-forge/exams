#### Overview

R/exams is based on exercises with either LaTeX or Markdown text and optional
R code to make the content [dynamic](/dynamic/). The format is agnostic to a
specific output format and can render the content into a wider variety of
files (PDF, HTML, Docx, XML, ...), either for direct usage or for import
into some [e-learning](/elearning/) system (like Moodle, Blackboard, OLAT,
or Ilias). Thus, the _same_ exercise can be exported into these different
formats - with multiple-choice and single-choice being the exercise format
supported by almost all learning management systems.
