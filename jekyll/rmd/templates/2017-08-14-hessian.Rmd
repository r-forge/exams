The coefficients of the function are drawn randomly and the correct answer has to be selected from five choice items. The latter are generated through <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">num_to_schoice()</code> by providing the other three elements of the Hessian as typical errors. Further random answers are taken from a prespecified range, assuring only integer solutions. Although the Hessian of a quadratic function has only constant elements, an argument vector is given in the exercise because other types of functions might have non-constant Hessians.",
