```{r generate question}
# Create a random integer vector of length 5
x <- sample(1:100, 5)
# Ask for the following index between 1:5
idx <- sample(1:5, 1)
# Wrong answers

Question
========
Vector subsetting in _R_. We can access elements/values
in a vectur using vector subsetting by index. Imagine we
have the following vector `x`:
```{r}
print(x)
```
If we call `x[`r idx`]`, what is the resulting value?

Answerlist
----------
* We get ``r x[wrong[1L]]``
* We get ``r x[wrong[2L]]``
* We get ``r x[idx]``

Solution
========
`x[`r idx`]` returns the `r idx`th element of the vector `x`
which is `r x[idx]`.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* Correct
