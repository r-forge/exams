\begin{question}
On 2013-05-03 one Euro (€) was buying \Sexpr{CURR[1]} US Dollars (\$) and
\Sexpr{CURR[2]} Britisch Pounds (\pounds). At Frankfurter Börse around
noon adidas AG was the largest winner compared with the day before
with a price of EUR \Sexpr{ADIDAS} per share. If you buy \Sexpr{nr}
shares, how much are they worth in \Sexpr{names(CURR)[cu]}?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The worth is the number of shares $\times$ stock price $\times$ exchange rate, i.e.,
$\Sexpr{nr} \times \Sexpr{ADIDAS} \times \Sexpr{CURR[cu]} \approx \Sexpr{x}$.
\end{solution}
