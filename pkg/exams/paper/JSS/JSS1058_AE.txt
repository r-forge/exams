
AE Report on JSS 1058

The manuscript was reviewed by two experts in the field. The first referee,
in general, likes idea, design, and implementation but faces several
technical problems when trying to set-up his/her own exam. The second
referee has a number of questions regarding possible extentions of the
package.

I agree with both referees that a paper on the exams package is suitable for
JSS. However, the authors should try to address the practical problems
reported by the first referee.
