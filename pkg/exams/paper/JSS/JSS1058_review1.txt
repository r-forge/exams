OLAT Assessments, and Beyond"

In general I like the idea and article, but the article is too long and
needs to be shortened.  A drawback is that the use of the software under
Ubuntu requires a lot of easily avoidable search in my linux system, search
in the internet and source code inspection:

* My first problem was the errormessage "... is not ASCII and does not
  declare an encoding".  The R help was useless since it was not clear how
  the exams package generates its Sweave files.  Finally I changed the
  encoding of my rnw files to ASCII via 'recode'.

* Since my first 'myexam' contained just my exam headers I got the next
  errormessage 'slength >= 1L is not TRUE'.  I guess that somehow the
  missing meta information in my rnw files is responsible for this.  Meta
  information seemed useless to me since my headers only contained fields
  for the student name, id and general hints.  An easy possibility to insert
  some static text without any exercise would have been nice.  A look in the
  2009 paper of Gr??n and Zeileis revealed that somewhere in my system the
  templates files used by the 'exams' package are hidden.  I found them
  under /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/exams/tex .  For writing an R package
  a command 'package.skeleton' exists, maybe something like this would be
  possible also for the exams package creating some template files like
  'plain' (solutions and exercises) and 'exam' (only exercises).  Finally, I
  solved this problem with extending the question environment with optional
  parameter which called \item[] ...  and creating an empty exercise with
  this optional parameter.

* After copying the template file in my working directory I created an exam
  only with "tstat.Rnw" with my own template file.  Integrating our logo as
  a PNG graphics in my own header file leads to the errormessage "!  LaTeX
  Error: File `logo' not found.".  After digging in the system I found under
  /tmp/RtmprrdDQN/file1c084150cdff/ the temporary directory used; identified
  by time stamp :( Of course the logo.png was not copied to the temporary
  directory.  Which meant for me I had to create my own temporary directory
  where I copied the missing file.  Maybe it would helpful either to add a
  parameter which allows to copy additional files or simply to copy all
  files from the working directory to the temporary directory.  I also guess
  if I integrate external graphics in my exercises the same will happen.

* After creating a subdirectory "exercises" with six exercises the following
  call gave the errormessage that exercise files can not be found: "Error in
  exams(myexam, template = "plain", edir = "./exercises", tdir = "./tmp") :
  The following files cannot be found: ...".  The exams command looked into
  "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/exams/exercises/./exercises" for the
  exercise files and an absolute path for edir was necessary.  It would be
  nice if the exams command would also search in subdirectories of the edir
  such that one can build a directory structure containing exercises
  seperated by topics.

* And again an encoding problem, but recoding did not help this time. The
  problem was that the current working directory was not my test directory
  but my home directory.  Therefore the plain.tex was again taken from
  "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/exams/tex" rather my own plain.tex from my
  test directory.  After changing the working directory of R to my test
  directory also the relative directory paths worked.

* Adding more exercises lead again to an encoding problem. Calling recode
  and cleaning my tmp directory helped now.

* Replacing in my R program 'exams' by 'exams2pdf'/'exams2moodle' lead to
  the error message "Error: slength >= 1L is not TRUE".  A internet search
  showed that the Metainformation \exsolution in the rnw-files was empty. 
  Again it was necessary to clean my tmp directory such that the corrected
  files will be copied there.

* After correcting this error 'exams2moodle' complained about "Error in if
  (x[n] == sep) return(x[-n]) : Argument has length 0".

The only thing what really worked without any problems was the most simple
example from the paper via copy and paste.  Creating my own exam was a pain. 
It took me more then a day to get a PDF version of a current exam by myself. 
A bit more information from the exams's command, e.g.  which directories are
used, more informative error messages would have helped a lot.  Since we are
transfering ourself statistics exercises from LaTeX to Moodle the
'exams2moodle' would have been interesting to us, but I'am not willing to
spend more time on it.

Until the software is not improved I can not recommend a publication of the
article.
