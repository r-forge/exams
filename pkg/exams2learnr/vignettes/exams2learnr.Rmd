## Overview

The package `exams2learnr` mainly provides the function of the same
name, `exams2learnr()`. It is an interface for embedding exercises
written with the R/exams package (<https://www.R-exams.org/>) in tutorials
or quizzes written with the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package.

The goal of `learnr` is the creation of interactive tutorials in a
[shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application written with R/Markdown.
The tutorials can contain individual exercises or quizzes from a set of exercises
along with text, graphics, and other elements you can embed in R/Markdown.
Usually, these tutorials can then be used for self-paced learning (rather than
assessment).

The `exams2learnr()` interface can be used within `learnr` tutorials to
dynamically insert individual questions or entire quizzes based on R/exams
exercise templates, either written in Rmd (R/Markdown) or Rnw (R/LaTeX) format.
Currently, there is support for the following question types:

| Description     | R/exams   | learnr            |
|:----------------|:----------|:------------------|
| Single-choice   | `schoice` | `learnr_radio`    |
| Multiple-choice | `mchoice` | `learnr_checkbox` |
| Text            | `string`  | `learnr_text`     |
| Numeric         | `num`     | `learnr_numeric`  |

Thus, there is no support, yet, for `cloze` questions that can combine all
of the elements above.


## First motivation

For quickly trying out how a certain R/exams exercise is rendered in
a `learnr` tutorial, there is the convenience function `run_quiz()`.
This sets up a tutorial embedding R/exams exercises in a temporary
directory and directly runs the tutorial in a `shiny` app.
For illustration, the code below creates a quiz containing one random
verions of each of these exercises (provided within the R/exams package):
[capitals](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/capitals/) (multiple-choice),
[fruit](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/fruit/) (numeric),
[function](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/function/) (string/text).
A screenshot is included below the code.

```{r}
library("exams2learnr")
run_quiz(c("capitals.Rmd", "fruit.Rmd", "function.Rmd"))
```

For full customization, however, it is recommended to set up a dedicated
tutorial R/Markdown file and use `exams2learnr()` explicitly to include
the exercises. This is illustrated below.


## Building blocks

The main function `exams2learnr()` can take one or more exercise
templates, either as a vector or as a list, just as for other
`exams2xyz()` interfaces. By default, this creates a single random
replication from (each of) the exercise(s), converts the text to
HTML, and wraps it into a suitable `learnr` object. For a single
exercise a `tutorial_question` is returned and for a vector/list
of exercises a `tutorial_quiz`. These defaults can be modified
and further arguments can be passed on to the underlying
`learnr` function calls to `question()` and `quiz()`, respectively.
This allows for customizing the appearance or controlling whether
multiple attempts are allowed, or whether hints/solutions are shown,
etc.

As a first example, we apply `exams2learnr()` to the string/text
[function](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/function/) exercise,
readily provided within the R/exams package. The result is represented
as a `learnr_text` object, inheriting from `tutorial_question`:

```{r}
qn <- exams2learnr("function.Rmd")
class(qn)
## [1] "learnr_text"       "tutorial_question"
print(qn)
## Question: "What is the name of the R function for extracting the fitted log-likelihood from a fitted (generalized) linear model object?"
##   type: "learnr_text"
##   allow_retry: FALSE
##   random_answer_order: FALSE
##   answers:
##     ✔: "logLik"
##   messages:
##     correct: "Correct!"
##     incorrect: "Incorrect"
##     message: "<code>logLik</code> is the R function for extracting the fitted log-likelihood from a fitted (generalized) linear model object.
## See <code>?logLik</code> for the corresponding manual page."
##   Options:
##     trim: TRUE 
```

Subsequently, we set up a quiz with the single-choice
[swisscapital](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/swisscapital/) exercise
and the multiple-choice
[switzerland](https://www.R-exams.org/templates/switzerland/) exercise,
represented as `learnr_radio` and `learnr_checkbox` objects, respectively,
contained in a `tutorial_quiz`.

```{r}
qz <- exams2learnr(c("swisscapital.Rmd", "switzerland.Rmd"))
class(qz)
## [1] "tutorial_quiz"
print(qz)
## Quiz: "Quiz"
## 
##   Question: "What is the seat of the federal authorities in Switzerland (i.e., the de facto capital)?"
##     type: "learnr_radio"
##     allow_retry: FALSE
##     random_answer_order: FALSE
##     answers:
##       X: "Zurich"
##       X: "Basel"
##       ✔: "Bern"
##       X: "Vaduz"
##       X: "Geneva"
##     messages:
##       correct: "Correct!"
##       incorrect: "Incorrect"
##       message: "There is no de jure capital but the de facto capital and seat of the federal authorities is Bern.</p>
## 
## <ul>
## <li>False</li>
## <li>False</li>
## <li>True</li>
## <li>False</li>
## <li>False</li>
## </ul>
## "
## 
##   Question: "Which of the following statements about Switzerland is correct?"
##     type: "learnr_checkbox"
##     allow_retry: FALSE
##     random_answer_order: FALSE
##     answers:
##       X: "The currency in Switzerland is the Euro."
##       ✔: "Italian is an official language in Switzerland."
##       ✔: "The Swiss national holiday is August 1."
##       X: "Switzerland is part of the European Union (EU)."
##       X: "Zurich is the capital of Switzerland."
##     messages:
##       correct: "Correct!"
##       incorrect: "Incorrect"
##       message: "<ul>
## <li>False. The currency is the Swiss Franc (CHF).</li>
## <li>True. The official languages are: German, French, Italian, Romansh.</li>
## <li>True. The establishment of the Swiss Confederation is traditionally dated to August 1, 1291.</li>
## <li>False. Switzerland is part of the Schengen Area but not the EU.</li>
## <li>False. There is no de jure capital but the de facto capital of Switzerland is Bern.</li>
## </ul>
## " 
```

If more than `n = 1` random replications are produced then a standard list
is returned - because `learnr` currently does not provide a compound object that can
capture a question bank with multiple replications. The list has one element per
random replication, each of which is a list of `tutorial_question` objects.

The format of the return value can also be controlled by the \code{output}
argument if the desired format is not selected automatically.

The next sections illustrate how to use this functionality in `learnr` Rmd
tutorials.


## Tutorial with a quiz

For setting up a `learnr` tutorial with a quiz based on R/exams exercises,
all building blocks are readily available now. In the YAML header the `output`
should be `learnr::tutorial` and the `runtime` should to be `shiny_prerendered`.
Then the quiz (or "exam") can be set up as a list as for other `exams2xyz()`
interfaces as well. The entire quiz is then prepared in one `exams2learnr()`
call. For illustration consider:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
writeLines(paste0("    ", readLines(
  system.file("learnr", "learnr_quiz.Rmd", package = "exams2learnr")
)))
```

The demo file above is actually shipped as a supplementary file `learnr_quiz.Rmd`
within the `exams2learnr` package. Hence, it can be `run()` as in the following command.
The screenshot below shows (one random replication of) the first exercises.
The concrete exercises will differ in every new `run()` of the tutorial.

```{r}
rmarkdown::run(system.file("learnr", "learnr_quiz.Rmd", package = "exams2learnr"))
```

## Tutorial with individual questions

`learnr_questions.Rmd`: All questions set up indvidually.

```{r}
rmarkdown::run(system.file("learnr", "learnr_questions.Rmd", package = "exams2learnr"))
```
