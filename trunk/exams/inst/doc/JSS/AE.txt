
AE report for JSS 420


The paper describing the design and application of the `exam' package
has been carefully reviewed by two referees. The `exam' package helps
to organize and maintain a collection of exercises which can be used
to automatically produce a potentially huge number of student-specific
exams. Both referees and the AE suggest to publish the manuscript after 
minor adjustments.

Two points should be addressed in the revision. Both referees ask to discuss 
the problem of rounding errors in more detail. This can be done by
extending the t-test example. The second referee suggests to
give recommendations how `good' questions should be formulated. While
I acknowledge that this is somewhat out of scope, one or two
paragraphs based on the authors' practical experience would make 
the paper more lively.

(Sorry for sending the second review in German, the referee argued
that all persons involed understand it. Well.)
