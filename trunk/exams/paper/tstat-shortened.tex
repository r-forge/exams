\begin{question}
  A machine fills milk into $500$ml packages. It is suspected that the 
  machine is not working correctly and that the amount of milk filled differs 
  from the setpoint $\mu_0 = 500$. A sample of $226$ packages filled by the 
  machine are collected. The sample mean $\bar{y}$ is equal to $517.2$ and 
  the sample variance $s^2_{n-1}$ is equal to $262.56$.

  Test the hypothesis that the amount filled corresponds on average to the 
  setpoint. What is the absolute value of the $t$~test statistic?
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
  The $t$~test statistic is calculated by:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    t & = & \frac{\bar y - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_{n-1}}{n}}}
    = \frac{517.2 - 500}{\sqrt{\frac{262.56}{226}}} = 15.958.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  The absolute value of the $t$~test statistic is thus equal to $15.958$.
\end{solution}
