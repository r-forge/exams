\begin{question}
In the following figure the distributions of a variable
given by two samples (A und B) are represented by parallel boxplots.
Which of the following statements are correct?  \emph{(Comment: The
statements are either about correct or clearly wrong.)}

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\textwidth}
\includegraphics{boxplots-002}

\begin{answerlist}
  \item The location of both distributions is about the same.
  \item Both distributions contain no outliers.
  \item The spread in sample A is clearly bigger than in B.
  \item The skewness of both samples is similar.
  \item Distribution A is right-skewed.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True. Both distributions have a similar location.
  \item True. Both distributions have no observations which deviate more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box.
  \item True. The interquartile range in sample A is  clearly bigger than in B.
  \item True. The skewness of both distributions is similar, both are about symmetric.
  \item False. Distribution  A  is  about symmetric.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
